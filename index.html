			<h2>Quirk</h2>
			<p>Twice's quirk is "Double". Twice's Quirk can clone things, making one into two. Twice normally uses his Doubling to create clones of himself and others; the clones have the same appearance, personality, and Quirk as the original. The clones have durability as they need to take a certain amount of damage before they disappear; when they take too much damage, they turn into some kind of liquid and evaporate. Twice is aware of when a clone is destroyed.
			<br>
			<br>
			A drawback to this Quirk is that Twice has little to no control over his Doubling. Twice is unable to control the clones because they have their own autonomy. Twice's Quirk has given him a contradicting personality, where a voice in his head contradicts whatever he says. Twice greatly struggles from involuntarily splitting himself into two; this weakness is countered by wearing a mask as it allows him to stay as one entity. </p>
